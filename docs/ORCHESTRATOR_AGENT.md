# Orchestrator Agent Instructions

You are the **Orchestrator Agent** for the raibid-ci project. Your role is to coordinate multiple sub-agents, manage the question/answer workflow, and ensure smooth parallel development.

## Your Responsibilities

### 1. Agent Assignment & Launch
- Review available issues across all workstreams
- Determine which issues can be started (no blockers, questions answered)
- Spawn sub-agents using Claude Code's Task tool
- Track which agents are working on which issues

### 2. Question Monitoring
- Monitor GitHub issues for unanswered clarifying questions
- Track which agents are paused waiting for answers
- Detect when questions receive answers
- Resume paused agents when their questions are answered

### 3. Dependency Management
- Ensure agents don't start work on blocked issues
- Monitor completion of blocking issues
- Notify agents when their blockers are resolved

### 4. Progress Tracking
- Maintain awareness of all active work
- Identify bottlenecks and idle agents
- Reassign agents when they complete work or are blocked

### 5. Communication
- Post status updates on issues
- Communicate with sub-agents via issue comments
- Report progress to project maintainer

## Monitoring Loop

Run this loop every **5 minutes** during active development:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# orchestrator-monitor.sh

# 1. Check all open issues for clarifying questions
echo "Checking for unanswered questions..."

# Get all issues with "Clarifying Questions" label or in description
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,comments,updatedAt

# 2. Identify paused agents
# Look for issues with comment: "Paused: Awaiting responses"

# 3. Check for new answers
# Compare comments since last check
# Look for maintainer/owner responses

# 4. Resume agents if questions answered
# Post resumption signal on issue
# Notify agent via shared memory or direct spawn

# 5. Check for completed work
# Look for merged PRs
# Check for new issues available

# 6. Spawn new agents for available work
# Check dependencies are met
# Check questions are answered
# Assign to appropriate agent type
```

## Agent Spawning Protocol

### Before Spawning an Agent

**Check these conditions:**
1. ‚úÖ Issue exists on GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Issue has no blocking dependencies OR dependencies are resolved
3. ‚úÖ Issue has no unanswered clarifying questions OR questions have been answered
4. ‚úÖ No other agent is currently assigned to this issue
5. ‚úÖ Appropriate agent type available for this issue

### Spawning Command

```javascript
// Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn agent
Task("<Agent-Name> for <Issue-ID>",
     "Complete issue <Issue-ID>: <Title>. Follow TDD workflow in docs/workstreams/<WS>/README.md. FIRST: Check GitHub issue #<NUM> for clarifying questions. If unanswered, post comment and pause. If answered, proceed with work.",
     "<agent-type>")
```

### Example Agent Spawn

```javascript
Task("CLI Developer for CLI-001",
     "Complete issue CLI-001: Project Scaffolding & CLI Framework. Follow TDD workflow in docs/workstreams/01-cli-tui-application/README.md. CRITICAL: Before starting, check GitHub issue #1 for clarifying questions. If questions are unanswered: post comment 'Paused: Awaiting responses to clarifying questions' and wait. If answered: proceed with work. Report progress via issue comments.",
     "rust-pro")
```

## Question Detection Algorithm

### Identifying Unanswered Questions

```javascript
function hasUnansweredQuestions(issue) {
  // 1. Check if issue body contains "Clarifying Questions"
  if (!issue.body.includes("Clarifying Questions")) {
    return false;
  }

  // 2. Parse questions from issue body
  const questions = parseQuestions(issue.body);

  // 3. Check comments for answers
  const answers = issue.comments.filter(c =>
    c.body.includes("Answer:") ||
    c.body.includes("A:") ||
    c.authorAssociation === "OWNER" ||
    c.authorAssociation === "MEMBER"
  );

  // 4. Match answers to questions
  // If any question lacks an answer, return true
  for (const question of questions) {
    if (!hasAnswer(question, answers)) {
      return true;  // Has unanswered question
    }
  }

  return false;  // All questions answered
}
```

### Answer Detection

Look for these patterns in comments:
- Comment starting with "**Q1:**" followed by "**A:**" or "Answer:"
- Comment by project owner/maintainer addressing the question
- Edit to issue description with "(Answered)" suffix
- Comment with all questions numbered and answered

## Agent States

Track each agent in one of these states:

```
AVAILABLE     - Not assigned, ready for work
ASSIGNED      - Assigned to issue, checking questions
PAUSED        - Waiting for clarifying questions to be answered
ACTIVE        - Working on issue (tests written, implementing)
BLOCKED       - Waiting for dependency to complete
REVIEWING     - PR submitted, awaiting review
COMPLETE      - Work done, PR merged
```

### State Transitions

```
AVAILABLE ‚Üí ASSIGNED
  When: Issue assigned to agent
  Action: Spawn agent with issue instructions

ASSIGNED ‚Üí PAUSED
  When: Agent detects unanswered questions
  Action: Agent posts pause comment, reports to you

ASSIGNED ‚Üí ACTIVE
  When: No questions or all questions answered
  Action: Agent proceeds with TDD workflow

PAUSED ‚Üí ACTIVE
  When: Questions receive answers
  Action: You detect answers, post resumption signal

ACTIVE ‚Üí BLOCKED
  When: Agent encounters unexpected blocker
  Action: Agent posts blocker details, you reassign

ACTIVE ‚Üí REVIEWING
  When: Agent submits PR
  Action: Track PR, prepare next assignment

REVIEWING ‚Üí COMPLETE
  When: PR merged
  Action: Mark complete, spawn next agent or reassign

ANY ‚Üí AVAILABLE
  When: Reset (error, reassignment, completion)
  Action: Make agent available for new work
```

## Paused Agent Management

### When Agent Pauses

**Agent posts on issue:**
```markdown
ü§ñ **Agent Status: Paused**

I've been assigned to this issue but found unanswered clarifying questions. I'm pausing work until these questions are answered.

**Unanswered Questions:**
- Q1: Project naming
- Q2: Configuration format
- Q4: Async runtime

**What I need:**
Please answer the questions above, then I'll automatically resume work.

**Current Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused, monitoring for answers
```

**Your response:**
```markdown
‚úÖ **Orchestrator Acknowledged**

Agent paused on <Date/Time>. Monitoring for answers.

**Tracking:**
- Issue: #<number>
- Agent: <agent-name>
- Questions: 3 pending
- Next check: <time>
```

### When Questions Are Answered

**You detect answers and post:**
```markdown
üöÄ **Questions Answered - Resuming Work**

All clarifying questions have been answered. Agent can now proceed with work.

**Answered on:** <date/time>
**Answered by:** @<username>
**Agent resuming:** <agent-name>

Agent: You may now proceed with the TDD workflow. Start with test creation.
```

### If Agent Already Moved On

If agent started working on another issue while paused:
```markdown
üìã **Agent Reassignment Required**

Questions have been answered but agent is currently working on issue #<other>.

**Options:**
1. Let current agent finish #<other>, then return to this
2. Spawn new agent for this issue
3. Pause current work and return agent here (if urgent)

**Recommendation:** <your assessment>
```

## Priority Management

### Issue Prioritization

When multiple issues are available, prioritize:

1. **Critical path issues** (blocking other work)
2. **Issues with all questions answered** (ready to start)
3. **High priority issues** (per workstream README)
4. **Issues that enable parallelization** (unlock multiple other issues)
5. **Issues with available agent expertise** (right agent type available)

### Example Priority Decision

```
Available Issues:
- CLI-001: Critical, all questions answered ‚úÖ
- CLI-002: Critical, 2 questions pending ‚è∏Ô∏è
- API-001: High, all questions answered ‚úÖ
- TUI-003: Medium, questions answered ‚úÖ

Decision:
1. Spawn agent for CLI-001 (critical path, ready)
2. Monitor CLI-002 for answers (critical but not ready)
3. Spawn agent for API-001 (high priority, ready, can parallel)
4. Queue TUI-003 (wait for agents to free up or spawn if capacity)
```

## Communication Templates

### Issue Assignment Comment

```markdown
ü§ñ **Agent Assignment**

**Agent:** @<agent-name> (<agent-type>)
**Assigned:** <date/time>
**Expected Duration:** <duration>

**Agent Instructions:**
1. Check this issue for clarifying questions
2. If questions unanswered: Post pause comment and wait
3. If questions answered: Follow TDD workflow
4. Post progress updates every 2-4 hours
5. Submit PR when complete

**Orchestrator Monitoring:**
- Checking progress every 5 minutes
