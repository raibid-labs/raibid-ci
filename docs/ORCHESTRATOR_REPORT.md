### Critical Path Analysis

**CLI-002 is the KEY TICKET** - It will create subsequent infrastructure issues for WS-02 through WS-07. This issue should be prioritized for question responses.

### Question Summary

**Total Questions:** 34
- Critical decisions: 6 (in CLI-002)
- Architecture affecting: 4
- Implementation details: 24

**Response Status:**
- Questions posted: 06:21-06:27 UTC
- Orchestrator acknowledgment: 07:25 UTC
- Time waiting: ~1.5 hours
- Target response time: <4 hours

## Orchestrator Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Initial Assessment** - Checked all 8 issues for status
2. ✅ **Posted Acknowledgments** - Added orchestrator tracking comments to all issues
3. ✅ **Created Monitoring Script** - `/scripts/orchestrator_monitor.sh` for continuous monitoring
4. ✅ **Established State Tracking** - JSON state file for agent assignments
5. ✅ **Documentation Created** - Status dashboard and reports

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor script location
/Users/beengud/raibid-labs/raibid-ci/scripts/orchestrator_monitor.sh

# Run every 5 minutes during active development
watch -n 300 /Users/beengud/raibid-labs/raibid-ci/scripts/orchestrator_monitor.sh
```

### State Management
- State file: `/tmp/raibid_orchestrator_state.json`
- Tracks which issues have spawned agents
- Prevents duplicate agent spawning

## Agent Pool Status

### Available Agents (Ready to Deploy)
- `rust-pro` - Rust development specialist (for CLI work)
- `tester` - Testing and QA
- `reviewer` - Code review
- `system-architect` - Architecture design
- `backend-dev` - API development
- `cicd-engineer` - CI/CD setup

### Agent Assignment Plan
Once questions are answered:
1. **CLI-001** → rust-pro agent (foundational)
2. **CLI-002** → rust-pro agent (creates future issues)
3. **CLI-003** → rust-pro agent (TUI setup)
4. **CLI-004-008** → Multiple agents in parallel

## Metrics & KPIs

### Current Performance
- **Agent utilization:** 0% (no agents spawned)
- **Issues blocked:** 100% (8/8)
- **Questions pending:** 34
- **Time waiting:** 1.5 hours

### Target Metrics
- **Agent utilization:** >70%
- **Question turnaround:** <4 hours
- **Issue completion:** 2-3 per day
- **PR cycle time:** <24 hours

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **CLI-002 questions unanswered** - Blocks multiple workstreams
- **No responses in 4 hours** - Development timeline impact

### Medium Risk
- **Partial answers** - May need clarification follow-ups
- **Agent coordination** - First multi-agent project test

### Mitigation
- Escalate CLI-002 if no response by 10:30 UTC
- Prepare contingency for partial answers
- Have backup agents ready for quick spawning

## Next 5 Actions

1. **Monitor for answers** - Check issues every 5 minutes
2. **Prioritize CLI-002** - Key ticket for future work
3. **Prepare agent spawning** - Have Task commands ready
4. **Update dashboard** - Refresh status every hour
5. **Escalate if needed** - Alert if no responses by deadline

## Recommendation

**URGENT**: The project maintainer should prioritize answering the clarifying questions, especially for CLI-002 which is blocking future work. The 6 questions in CLI-002 are critical decision points that affect the entire infrastructure setup.

## Communication Log

| Time | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 07:25 | Posted acknowledgments | All 8 issues tracked |
| 07:26 | Created monitor script | Automated checking enabled |
| 07:27 | Initial status check | All issues waiting |
| 07:30 | Status report created | This document |

## Orchestrator Command Center

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check all issues
gh issue list --state open

# Check specific issue for answers
gh issue view 2 --json comments

# Run monitor
/Users/beengud/raibid-labs/raibid-ci/scripts/orchestrator_monitor.sh

# Check agent state
cat /tmp/raibid_orchestrator_state.json

# Post update on issue
gh issue comment <number> --body "Status update..."
```

### Agent Spawn Templates (Ready to Execute)
```javascript
// CLI-001 Agent (when ready)
Task("Rust Developer for CLI-001",
     "Complete CLI-001: Project Scaffolding. Questions answered. Follow TDD in docs/workstreams/01-cli-tui-application/README.md. Start with tests.",
     "rust-pro")

// CLI-002 Agent (when ready) - CRITICAL
Task("Rust Developer for CLI-002",
     "Complete CLI-002: Mock Infrastructure Commands. This is KEY TICKET - creates future issues. Follow TDD carefully. Create issue generation script.",
     "rust-pro")
```

## Conclusion

The orchestrator is fully operational and monitoring all 8 issues. The system is ready to spawn agents immediately upon receiving question answers. CLI-002 should be prioritized as it unlocks future workstreams.
