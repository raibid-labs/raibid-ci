# Project Setup Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

The raibid-ci project has been fully organized for multi-agent parallel development with a CLI/TUI-first approach, comprehensive TDD workflows, clarifying question management, and orchestrator coordination.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ‚úÖ Workstream Reorganization (CLI/TUI First)

**Old Priority:** Infrastructure ‚Üí Application
**New Priority:** Application ‚Üí Infrastructure

**Workstream Order:**
1. **WS-01: CLI/TUI Application** (8 issues) - START HERE
2. **WS-02: CI Agent Core** (build logic)
3. **WS-03: API Services** (backend)
4. **WS-04: Infrastructure Provisioning** (k3s, Gitea, Redis)
5. **WS-05: Data Services** (deployment)
6. **WS-06: GitOps & Orchestration** (Flux, KEDA)
7. **WS-07: Repository Management** (mirroring)
8. **WS-08: Integration & Deployment** (testing)

**Directories:**
- `docs/workstreams/01-cli-tui-application/` through `08-integration-deployment/`
- All renamed and reorganized

### 2. ‚úÖ TDD Workflows Added

**Every workstream now has:**
- 12-step TDD workflow
- Test-first development enforced
- PR acceptance criteria
- Code quality requirements
- Continuation logic for sequential issues

**Examples:**
- Rust workstreams: Unit tests, integration tests, cargo clippy
- Infrastructure workstreams: Validation scripts, health checks

### 3. ‚úÖ Clarifying Questions System

**File:** `docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md`

**Contains:**
- Questions for each issue in WS-01 (26 total questions across 8 issues)
- Placeholder sections for other workstreams
- Question lifecycle protocol
- Answer format templates
- Agent pause/resume workflow

**Examples of Questions:**
- CLI-001: "Should binary be `raibid` or `raibid-cli`?" (4 questions)
- CLI-002: "Should dry-run be default?" (6 questions) - **KEY TICKET**
- CLI-003: "Is 1-second refresh too fast?" (4 questions)
- CLI-007: "YAML or TOML for config?" (4 questions)

### 4. ‚úÖ Orchestrator Agent

**File:** `docs/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md`

**Capabilities:**
- Monitors GitHub issues every 5 minutes
- Detects answered questions and resumes paused agents
- Manages agent states (AVAILABLE, ASSIGNED, PAUSED, ACTIVE, BLOCKED, REVIEWING, COMPLETE)
- Tracks dependencies and unblocks work
- Posts status updates and progress reports
- Spawns new agents using Claude Code Task tool
- Maintains project dashboard view

**Key Features:**
- Question detection algorithm
- Agent health checks
- Priority management
- Communication templates
- Error recovery procedures
- Success metrics tracking

### 5. ‚úÖ Repository Configuration

**Settings Applied:**
```json
{
  "squashMergeAllowed": true,     ‚úÖ ONLY merge method
  "mergeCommitAllowed": false,    ‚úÖ Disabled
  "rebaseMergeAllowed": false,    ‚úÖ Disabled
  "deleteBranchOnMerge": true     ‚úÖ Auto-cleanup
}
```

**Result:**
- **Linear history enforced** - No merge commits possible
- **Squash-merge only** - GitHub UI only shows "Squash and merge" button
- **Automatic branch cleanup** - Branches deleted after merge
- **No agent instruction changes needed** - Platform enforces behavior

### 6. ‚úÖ Key Documents Created

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md` | Multi-agent orchestration guide | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md` | Questions for all issues | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md` | Orchestrator instructions | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/workstreams/START_HERE.md` | Quick start guide | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/workstreams/README.md` | Workstream overview | ‚úÖ Updated |
| `docs/workstreams/STRUCTURE.md` | Structure summary | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/workstreams/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` | Reorganization details | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/workstreams/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` | Initial completion status | ‚úÖ Created |
| `docs/diagrams/workstream-dependencies.md` | Dependency diagram | ‚úÖ Created |

### 7. ‚úÖ WS-01: CLI/TUI Application

**Completely rewritten with 8 issues:**

- **CLI-001:** Project Scaffolding (0.5 days)
- **CLI-002:** Mock Infrastructure Commands (1.5 days) - **KEY TICKET**
- **CLI-003:** Ratatui Setup & Basic Dashboard (1.5 days)
- **CLI-004:** TUI Widgets & Mock Data Display (2 days)
- **CLI-005:** Interactive Controls & Navigation (1.5 days)
- **CLI-006:** Additional Mock Commands (1 day)
- **CLI-007:** Configuration Management (1 day)
- **CLI-008:** Testing & Documentation (1 day)

**Total:** 10 days estimated duration

**Philosophy:** Build the interface first with realistic mocks, then wire to real infrastructure later.

## How It Works

### Agent Workflow

```
1. Orchestrator assigns issue to agent
   ‚Üì
2. Agent checks GitHub issue for clarifying questions
   ‚Üì
3a. Questions unanswered?          3b. Questions answered?
    ‚Üì                                  ‚Üì
4a. Agent posts pause comment      4b. Agent posts start comment
    Agent waits                        Agent proceeds
    ‚Üì                                  ‚Üì
5a. Orchestrator monitors          5b. Agent follows TDD workflow:
    Detects answers                    - Checkout branch
    Resumes agent                      - Write tests FIRST
    ‚Üì                                  - Commit tests
6a. Agent proceeds                     - Implement
                                       - Tests pass
                                       - Create PR
                                       ‚Üì
7. PR reviewed and squash-merged (automatic via repo settings)
   ‚Üì
8. Branch auto-deleted
   ‚Üì
9. Agent reports completion to orchestrator
   ‚Üì
10. Orchestrator assigns next issue
```

### Orchestrator Monitoring Loop (Every 5 min)

```bash
1. Check all open issues for unanswered questions
2. Identify paused agents
3. Detect new answers on issues
4. Resume paused agents
5. Check for completed PRs
6. Spawn agents for new available work
7. Update project dashboard
8. Post status updates
```

### Example Issue Lifecycle

```
Day 1, 09:00 - Issue CLI-001 created with clarifying questions
Day 1, 09:05 - Agent assigned to CLI-001
Day 1, 09:06 - Agent checks issue, finds 4 questions
Day 1, 09:06 - Agent posts: "Paused: Awaiting answers"
Day 1, 09:07 - Orchestrator logs pause
Day 1, 10:30 - Maintainer answers all 4 questions
Day 1, 10:35 - Orchestrator detects answers (next monitor cycle)
Day 1, 10:36 - Orchestrator posts: "Resuming agent"
Day 1, 10:37 - Agent proceeds with TDD workflow
Day 1, 10:45 - Agent commits tests (failing)
Day 1, 11:30 - Agent commits implementation (tests passing)
Day 1, 12:00 - Agent creates PR
Day 1, 14:00 - PR reviewed and squash-merged
Day 1, 14:01 - Branch auto-deleted
Day 1, 14:02 - Agent reports completion
Day 1, 14:05 - Orchestrator assigns CLI-002 to agent
```

## Quick Start

### Launch Orchestrator

**Option 1: Using the script (recommended)**
```bash
nu scripts/launch-orchestrator.nu
```
This will check prerequisites, show project status, and provide instructions.

**Option 2: Direct Claude Code Task spawn**
```javascript
// In Claude Code, spawn orchestrator
Task("Orchestrator",
     "You are the orchestrator for raibid-ci. Follow instructions in docs/ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT.md. Monitor GitHub issues every 5 minutes for unanswered clarifying questions. When questions are answered, spawn development agents. Track agent states, manage dependencies, and post progress updates.",
     "tdd-orchestrator")
```

### Launch Initial Agents (via Orchestrator)

**After orchestrator creates issues with questions:**

```javascript
// Orchestrator spawns these once questions are answered
Task("CLI Developer",
     "Complete CLI-001. Check GitHub issue for clarifying questions FIRST. If unanswered, pause. If answered, follow TDD workflow in docs/workstreams/01-cli-tui-application/README.md.",
     "rust-pro")

// Can run in parallel (if questions answered)
Task("API Developer",
     "Complete API-001. Check issue for questions. Follow workflow in docs/workstreams/03-api-services/README.md.",
     "rust-pro")
```

- Add clarifying questions for those workstreams
- Update other workstream READMEs with question-check workflow
- Create any additional documentation as needed during development

## Philosophy & Benefits

### CLI/TUI First Approach
- **Define interface contract** before implementation
- **Mock everything** - Test UX without infrastructure complexity
- **Parallel development** - CLI, API, Agents can all develop simultaneously
- **Reduced risk** - Infrastructure guided by interface needs

### TDD Enforced
- **Tests before code** - Ensures testability
- **No untested code** - Every feature has tests
- **Better design** - TDD leads to better architecture
- **Living documentation** - Tests show how to use code

### Question/Answer System
- **Clarify requirements early** - Before wasting effort
- **Document decisions** - On issues for future reference
- **Prevent rework** - Build it right the first time
- **Enable async work** - Agents work on other issues while waiting

### Orchestrator Coordination
- **Central management** - One entity tracks everything
- **Efficient resource use** - Agents never idle unnecessarily
- **Dependency handling** - Work proceeds in correct order
- **Progress visibility** - Always know project status

### Repository Settings
- **Linear history** - Easy to understand and bisect
- **Clean commits** - Squash merge keeps history tidy
- **Auto cleanup** - No branch management overhead
- **Enforced by platform** - Can't accidentally violate

## Success Metrics

**Target:**
- Agent utilization >70%
- Question turnaround <4 hours
- Issue completion: 2-3 per day (team of 4-6 agents)
- PR cycle time <24 hours
- Zero untested code

**Track:**
- Issues completed
- PRs merged
- Questions answered
- Blockers encountered
- Agent idle time

## Project Timeline Estimate

**With 4-6 parallel agents:**
- **Phase 1:** WS-01, WS-03 (CLI/TUI, API) - 5-7 days
- **Phase 2:** WS-02, WS-04 (Agents, Infrastructure) - 4-6 days
- **Phase 3:** WS-05, WS-06 (Data, GitOps) - 3-5 days
- **Phase 4:** WS-07, WS-08 (Mirrors, Integration) - 3-5 days

**Total: 21-31 days** (original estimate, now with better coordination)

## Notes

- **Start with WS-01** - It's completely ready with all 8 issues detailed
- **CLI-002 is critical** - It creates issues for WS-04 infrastructure work
- **Orchestrator is key** - Don't skip this, it coordinates everything
- **Answer questions quickly** - Agents can't work while paused
- **Trust the system** - TDD workflow ensures quality

## Credits

- **Methodology:** TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- **Architecture:** SPARC (when applied)
- **Coordination:** Multi-agent orchestration
- **Tools:** Claude Code Task tool, GitHub CLI, Cargo, Ratatui
