# WS-01: CLI/TUI Application

## Description

Build the primary Rust-based CLI/TUI application for managing the CI system. This workstream focuses on the user interface layer first, with mock commands for infrastructure operations. The CLI provides both command-line interface and terminal UI (Ratatui) for monitoring and management.

**Philosophy:** Build the interface first with realistic mock data, then wire it up to real infrastructure later. This allows rapid iteration on UX before infrastructure complexity.

## Dependencies

**Blockers:** None - can start immediately

**Blocks:**
- WS-04: Infrastructure Provisioning (CLI commands will trigger infrastructure)
- WS-08: Integration & Deployment (needs CLI for end-to-end testing)

## Priority

**Critical** - User interface drives development workflow

## Estimated Duration

4-6 days

## Parallelization

Can run in parallel with:
- WS-02: CI Agent Core (build logic development)
- WS-03: API Services (backend development)

Within this workstream:
- CLI-001 must complete first (scaffolding)
- CLI-002 after CLI-001 (mock commands)
- CLI-003, CLI-004 can run in parallel after CLI-002
- CLI-005, CLI-006 can run in parallel after CLI-004
- CLI-007, CLI-008 can run in parallel after CLI-005, CLI-006

## Agent Workflow

Follow this TDD-based workflow for each issue in this workstream:

### 1. Issue Selection & Question Check

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Check for clarifying questions BEFORE starting any work**

- Review all issues in this workstream (listed below)
- Select the next issue that is:
  - Not yet started (no branch exists)
  - Not blocked by dependencies
  - Highest priority among available issues
- Check parallelization notes to identify issues that can run concurrently

**Question Check Protocol:**
1. **Check GitHub issue** for "Clarifying Questions" section
2. **If questions exist and are UNANSWERED:**
   ```bash
   # Post this comment on the GitHub issue
   gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "ü§ñ **Agent Status: Paused**

   I've been assigned to this issue but found unanswered clarifying questions.
   I'm pausing work until these questions are answered.

   **Unanswered Questions:**
   [List questions that need answers]

   **Current Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused, monitoring for answers
   **Next Steps:** Will resume automatically when questions are answered

   See docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md for details."

   # Report to orchestrator
   # DO NOT proceed to step 2 (Branch Creation)
   # WAIT for orchestrator to signal that questions are answered
   ```
3. **If questions are ANSWERED or NO questions exist:**
   ```bash
   # Post this comment on the GitHub issue
   gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "ü§ñ **Agent Starting Work**

   Clarifying questions have been answered (or no questions required).
   Proceeding with TDD workflow.

   **Starting:** $(date)
   **Expected Duration:** [duration from issue]
   **Next Update:** Will post progress update in 2-4 hours"

   # Proceed to step 2 (Branch Creation)
   ```

**Reference:** See `docs/CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS.md` for all questions by issue

### 2. Branch Creation
```bash
# Checkout new branch named after the issue
git checkout -b <issue-id>-<brief-description>
# Example: git checkout -b cli-001-project-scaffold
```

### 3. Test-First Development (TDD)
**Write tests BEFORE implementation:**

For Rust CLI/TUI code, create unit and integration tests:

**Example test structure:**
```rust
// tests/cli_commands_test.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use assert_cmd::Command;

    #[test]
    fn test_cli_help_command() {
        let mut cmd = Command::cargo_bin("raibid-cli").unwrap();
        cmd.arg("--help");
        cmd.assert().success();
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_setup_command_mock() {
        let mut cmd = Command::cargo_bin("raibid-cli").unwrap();
        cmd.arg("setup").arg("--dry-run");
        cmd.assert().success();
    }
}
```

**Test types for CLI/TUI:**
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration tests**: Test CLI commands end-to-end (use `assert_cmd`)
- **UI snapshot tests**: Verify Ratatui rendering (use `insta` crate)
- **Mock tests**: Use mock responses for infrastructure calls

### 4. Initial Test Commit
```bash
# Create test files
mkdir -p tests/
# Write your tests in tests/ directory

# Ensure tests compile (they should fail, but must compile!)
cargo test --no-run

# Add test files
git add src/ tests/ Cargo.toml

# Commit tests
git commit -m "test: add tests for <issue-id>

- Add unit tests for <functionality>
- Add integration tests for <component>
- Tests currently failing (expected before implementation)

Relates to <issue-id>"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### 5. Implementation
Implement the functionality to make tests pass:
- Follow the task list in the issue description
- Use TDD: write test ‚Üí watch it fail ‚Üí implement ‚Üí watch it pass
- Run `cargo test` frequently
- Use `cargo watch -x test` for automatic test running
- Keep commits small and focused

**For Rust CLI development:**
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode during development
cargo watch -x test

# Run specific test
cargo test test_cli_help_command

# Run CLI manually for testing
cargo run -- setup --dry-run
```

### 6. Implementation Commits
```bash
# Make incremental commits as you implement
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(<issue-id>): <what you implemented>

<detailed description of changes>

- Implements <feature>
- Adds <functionality>
- Tests passing: <test names>

### CLI-002: Mock Infrastructure Commands
**Priority:** Critical | **Complexity:** Medium | **Duration:** 1.5 days

**THIS IS THE KEY TICKET** - Create placeholder CLI commands for infrastructure management. These commands will print what they would do but not actually execute operations. This establishes the interface contract before infrastructure implementation.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `setup` command with full argument parsing:
  ```bash
  raibid-cli setup [OPTIONS]
    --dry-run              Show what would be done (default)
    --execute              Actually perform setup (disabled in mock)
    --components <LIST>    Components to set up: k3s, gitea, redis, keda, all
    --skip-verify          Skip pre-flight checks
    --config <PATH>        Use custom config file
  ```
- [ ] Create `teardown` command:
  ```bash
  raibid-cli teardown [OPTIONS]
    --dry-run              Show what would be done
    --force                Skip confirmation prompts
    --preserve-data        Keep data volumes
    --components <LIST>    Components to teardown
  ```
- [ ] Create `status` command:
  ```bash
  raibid-cli status [OPTIONS]
    --component <NAME>     Check specific component
    --json                 Output as JSON
    --watch                Continuous monitoring mode
    --verbose             Show detailed status
  ```
- [ ] Implement mock responses (detailed, realistic output):
  - "Would install k3s v1.28 on current node (ARM64)"
  - "Would deploy Gitea 1.21 with 100GB PVC at gitea.dgx.local"
  - "Would configure Redis 7.2 with Streams enabled"
  - "Would deploy KEDA 2.12 with Redis Streams scaler"
  - Show estimated time for each operation
  - Show resource requirements (CPU, RAM, disk)
- [ ] Add pre-flight checks (mock):
  - Check system requirements (CPU, RAM, disk)
  - Check network connectivity
  - Check required ports available
  - Check prerequisites installed (Docker, etc.)
- [ ] Create progress indicators using `indicatif` crate:
  - Spinners for in-progress operations
  - Progress bars for multi-step operations
  - Clear success/failure indicators
- [ ] Implement colored output using `colored` crate:
  - Green for success
  - Yellow for warnings
  - Red for errors
  - Blue for informational
- [ ] Add detailed help text for each command
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests:
  - Unit tests for command parsing
  - Integration tests for command execution
  - Test all flag combinations
- [ ] Create separate issues for each command implementation:
  - Create issue: "Implement setup command - k3s installation"
  - Create issue: "Implement setup command - Gitea deployment"
  - Create issue: "Implement setup command - Redis deployment"
  - Create issue: "Implement teardown command - resource cleanup"
  - Create issue: "Implement status command - cluster health checks"

**Mock Output Example:**
```
$ raibid-cli setup --components k3s,gitea --dry-run

üîç Pre-flight checks:
  ‚úì System requirements met (20 cores, 128GB RAM, 4TB disk)
  ‚úì Network connectivity verified
  ‚úì Ports 6443, 3000, 2222 available
  ‚ö† Docker not installed (will be installed by k3s)

üìã Setup plan:
  1. Install k3s v1.28 (ARM64)
     - Estimated time: 2-3 minutes
     - Resources: 2 cores, 2GB RAM

  2. Deploy Gitea 1.21
     - Estimated time: 5-7 minutes
     - Resources: 2 cores, 4GB RAM, 100GB disk
     - URL: http://gitea.dgx.local:3000

üí° To execute this plan, run:
   raibid-cli setup --components k3s,gitea --execute

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: --execute flag is not yet implemented (mock mode only)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All commands parse arguments correctly
- `--help` for each command shows comprehensive options
- Commands print clear, actionable mock output with realistic details
- Pre-flight checks execute and show results
- Progress indicators work correctly
- Colored output enhances readability

- [ ] Create Rust struct for config using `serde`:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
  struct Config {
      cluster: ClusterConfig,
      resources: ResourcesConfig,
      cache: CacheConfig,
      // ... etc
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement config loading with priority:
  1. Command-line flags (highest priority)
  2. Environment variables (with `${VAR}` expansion)
  3. Project-local config: `./raibid.yaml`
  4. User config: `~/.config/raibid/config.yaml`
  5. System config: `/etc/raibid/config.yaml`
  6. Defaults (lowest priority)
- [ ] Implement config validation:
  - Check required fields present
  - Validate value ranges (e.g., cpu_per_agent > 0)
  - Validate URLs and paths
  - Check mutually exclusive options
- [ ] Create `config` subcommands:
  ```bash
  raibid-cli config init [PATH]
    --minimal             Create minimal config
    --full                Create fully documented config
    --overwrite           Overwrite existing config

  raibid-cli config show
    --json                Output as JSON
    --resolved            Show after env var expansion

  raibid-cli config validate [--file PATH]
    --strict              Fail on warnings

  raibid-cli config edit
    # Opens config in $EDITOR

  raibid-cli config path
    # Show which config file is being used
  ```
- [ ] Create example configurations:
  - `examples/config.example.yaml` - Fully documented template
  - `examples/config.minimal.yaml` - Minimal working config
  - `examples/config.production.yaml` - Production-ready settings
  - `examples/config.development.yaml` - Development settings
- [ ] Implement environment variable expansion:
  - `${VAR}` - Required variable (error if not set)
  - `${VAR:-default}` - Optional with default
  - Document all expandable variables
- [ ] Add config merge logic (for multiple config sources)
- [ ] Write configuration guide in README:
  - Configuration file locations
  - Configuration priority
  - Environment variables
  - All configuration options explained
  - Examples for common scenarios
- [ ] Write tests:
  - Test config loading from all sources
  - Test priority/merging
  - Test validation
  - Test environment variable expansion

**Success Criteria:**
- Config files load successfully from all locations
- Validation catches errors clearly with helpful messages
- `config init` creates working config
- Environment variables override file settings correctly
- `config show --resolved` shows fully expanded config
- Documentation is complete and clear
- Tests pass for all config operations

## Deliverables

- [ ] Rust CLI application with clap-based argument parsing
- [ ] Mock commands for all infrastructure operations (setup, teardown, status, etc.)
- [ ] Full-featured Ratatui TUI with mock data
- [ ] Interactive controls and navigation
- [ ] Configuration management system with multiple sources
- [ ] Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Complete documentation (CLI reference, TUI guide, examples)
- [ ] Demo video/GIF showing key features
- [ ] README with usage examples and screenshots
- [ ] Man page and shell completions

## Success Criteria

- `cargo build --release` succeeds without warnings
- CLI help text is clear and complete
- All mock commands execute successfully with realistic output
- TUI launches and displays mock data correctly
- TUI performs well over SSH connections (important for DGX Spark)
- Configuration system works correctly with all sources
- All tests pass (unit + integration)
- Documentation is comprehensive and easy to follow
- Binary size < 10MB
- Code passes `cargo clippy` and `cargo audit`

## Notes

- **Focus on UI/UX first** - Real infrastructure integration comes in WS-04
- **Mock data should be realistic** - Helps with testing and development
- **TUI must work over low-bandwidth SSH** - Critical for DGX Spark access
- **CLI commands establish the interface contract** - Infrastructure implementations will match these interfaces
- **Use `assert_cmd` for CLI testing** - Makes integration tests easy
- **Use Ratatui examples as reference** - Well-documented patterns
- **Consider terminal compatibility** - Test with multiple terminals
- **Error messages should be helpful** - Guide users to solutions
- **Create separate issues in CLI-002** for each command implementation that will happen in WS-04

## Future Workstreams Dependencies

This workstream establishes the interface that will be implemented in:
- **WS-04: Infrastructure Provisioning** - Real implementation of setup/teardown/status commands
- **WS-06: GitOps & Orchestration** - Real data for TUI from Kubernetes/KEDA
- **WS-08: Integration & Deployment** - End-to-end testing with real infrastructure
