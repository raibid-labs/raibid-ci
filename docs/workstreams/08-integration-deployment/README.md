# WS-08: Integration & Deployment

## Description

Final integration phase bringing all components together for end-to-end testing, performance tuning, and production readiness. This workstream validates the complete CI system.

## Dependencies

**Blockers:**
- WS-01: Infrastructure Core (requires k3s cluster)
- WS-02: Data Services (requires Gitea + Redis)
- WS-03: GitOps & Orchestration (requires Flux + KEDA)
- WS-04: API Services (requires API deployed)
- WS-05: Client TUI (requires TUI functional)
- WS-06: CI Agents (requires agents operational)
- WS-07: Repository Management (requires mirroring)

**Blocks:** None - this is the final phase

## Priority

**Critical** - Validates entire system

## Estimated Duration

3-5 days

## Parallelization

**Sequential workstream** - cannot start until all other workstreams complete.

Some issues can run in parallel within this workstream:
- INTEG-002, INTEG-003, INTEG-004 can run in parallel
- INTEG-006, INTEG-007 can run in parallel
