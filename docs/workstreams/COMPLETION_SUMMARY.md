## 📝 TDD Workflow Status

### ✅ Workflows Added (2/8)
- **WS-01: Infrastructure Core** - Validation test-based TDD workflow
- **WS-04: API Services** - Rust unit/integration test TDD workflow

### ⏳ Workflows Needed (6/8)
- **WS-02: Data Services** - Infrastructure validation workflow
- **WS-03: GitOps & Orchestration** - Infrastructure validation workflow
- **WS-05: Client TUI** - Rust TDD workflow (same as WS-04)
- **WS-06: CI Agents** - Rust TDD workflow (same as WS-04)
- **WS-07: Repository Management** - Mixed (scripts + infrastructure)
- **WS-08: Integration & Deployment** - End-to-end testing workflow

## 🎯 Workflow Templates Available

### For Rust Workstreams (WS-04, WS-05, WS-06)
Template created with:
- Unit and integration test examples
- `cargo test` workflow
- `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` checks
- PR acceptance criteria
- Error handling requirements

Apply to: WS-05, WS-06 (same pattern as WS-04)

### For Infrastructure Workstreams (WS-01, WS-02, WS-03)
Template created with:
- Bash validation test examples
- `kubectl` verification commands
- Service health checks
- Manifest validation
- Deployment testing

Apply to: WS-02, WS-03 (same pattern as WS-01)

### For Mixed Workstreams (WS-07)
Needs custom workflow combining:
- Nushell/Rust script testing
- API integration testing
- Configuration validation

### For Integration Workstream (WS-08)
Needs end-to-end testing workflow:
- Full pipeline testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Failure scenario testing
- Production readiness checks

## 📊 Project Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Workstreams | 8 |
| Total Issues | 59 |
| Can Start Immediately | 3 (WS-01, WS-04, WS-05) |
| Blocked Initially | 5 (WS-02, WS-03, WS-06, WS-07, WS-08) |
| Critical Path Duration | 14-19 days minimum |
| Realistic Duration | 21-31 days |
| Recommended Agents | 3-6 parallel |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Review Structure (Recommended)
1. Review `docs/workstreams/START_HERE.md`
2. Review `docs/ORCHESTRATION.md`
3. Review individual workstream READMEs
4. Verify dependencies and parallelization make sense
5. Request workflow additions for remaining workstreams if needed

### Option 2: Start Immediately
1. Launch Phase 1 agents using templates in `START_HERE.md`
2. Agents follow TDD workflows in their workstream READMEs
3. Add remaining workflows as agents reach those workstreams

### Option 3: Complete Workflows First
Request addition of TDD workflows to remaining 6 workstreams before launching agents.

## 🎯 Quick Launch Command

To start Phase 1 immediately:

```javascript
// In Claude Code, execute:
Task("Infra Agent",
     "Complete WS-01: Infrastructure Core. Follow docs/workstreams/01-infrastructure-core/README.md. Use validation tests.",
     "cloud-architect")

Task("API Agent",
     "Complete WS-04: API Services. Follow docs/workstreams/04-api-services/README.md. Rust TDD workflow.",
     "rust-pro")

Task("TUI Agent",
     "Complete WS-05: Client TUI. Follow docs/workstreams/05-client-tui/README.md. Rust TDD workflow.",
     "rust-pro")
```

Note: WS-05 workflow not yet added, but agent can follow WS-04 pattern since both are Rust.

## 📚 Key Documents Created

## ✅ Review Checklist

Before launching agents, verify:

- [ ] Workstream structure makes sense
- [ ] Dependencies are correct
- [ ] Parallelization opportunities are clear
- [ ] Issue breakdown is appropriate
- [ ] TDD workflow is acceptable (WS-01, WS-04 examples)
- [ ] PR acceptance criteria are sufficient
- [ ] Orchestration guide is clear

## 🔧 Customization Options

If you want to customize:
1. **Adjust priorities** - Edit individual workstream READMEs
2. **Change dependencies** - Update workstream README dependencies sections
3. **Modify workflows** - Edit TDD workflow sections
4. **Add issues** - Add new issue placeholders in workstream READMEs
5. **Change agent types** - Update recommended agents in ORCHESTRATION.md
